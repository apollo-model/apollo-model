# Graphex

Graphex is an open source no-code framework to build and deploy GraphQL backends quickly without much effort from the engineering teams. You can create your GraphQL models and get a fully functional GraphQL server that supports "CRUD" like operations against your data source. 

## Features
- CRUD like operations on GraphQL types
- Automatic Filters for Queries
- Relations between types with OOTB operations
- Work with sub-documents (MongoDB only)
- Support GraphQL Federation and external relations
